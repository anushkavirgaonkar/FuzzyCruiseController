# FuzzyCruiseController
Implementation of Greg Viotâ€™s Fuzzy Cruise Controller using Fuzzy Logic.

## Introduction
Many fuzzy control systems are tasked to keep a certain variable close to a specific value. For instance, the speed of the cruise needs to be kept relatively constant. A fuzzy control system links fuzzy variables using a set of rules. These rules are simply mappings that describe how one or more fuzzy variables relates to another. Using these rules, a system is developed which gives the output corresponding to the set of input values. 

## Implementation
The system is implemented in the Python programming language using scikit-fuzzy, which is a fuzzy logic Python package that works with numpy arrays. We create the three fuzzy variables - two inputs, one output (error, delta, output).

We then define the complex set of rules in the fuzzy system.

Based on these rules, the fuzzy controller system predicts the output values.

With helpful use of Matplotlib and repeated simulations, we can observe what the entire control system surface looks like in three dimensions.
